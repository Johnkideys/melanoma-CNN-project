# Melanoma detection using CNNs

This repository contains the code for CNN models developed for my MSc thesis project titled "Deep Learning for Melanoma Skin Cancer Classification
". The project studies and evaluates various pretrained CNN architectures (MobileNetV2, ResNet, DenseNet) on the ISIC 2017 dataset for binary classification of melanoma vs non-melanoma skin lesions.
